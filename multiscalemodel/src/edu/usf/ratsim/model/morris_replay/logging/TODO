Morris Replay Model TODO file

*Improve drawing efficiency
*Change Logging System: currently, a tree is created "logFolder/group/ratId/trial/episode"
      Instead, provide a separate logFolder for each type of log, and store all log files inside that folder, substitute tree by file name
*Make all loggers binary file loggers
*Add database



*Add draw W matrix
*change update equations for Q
*change update rule to Q(s,a) so that update Q(t,s_t,a)<- Q(t,s_t,a) + delta * (r+gamma*v(t,s_t+1)-Q(t,s_t,a_t))
*change replay method 
	- allow moving through non max path
	- change dynamics
	- change data structure
	- incorporate reward idea to replay
	- change update method while asleep
	- do not update negative values
	- Weighted average vs always adding: average does not know how frequently a pair is visited, adding can go to infinity
*Update PC equation
*revive plotting system
	-save frames to files
