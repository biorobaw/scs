Morris Replay Model TODO file

*Must improve efficiency of model: currently taking about 30 mins to execute
	*Add SingleBlockMatrix to be used with TesselatedPCLayer
	*Improve WUpdater efficiency

*Change Logging System: currently, a tree is created "logFolder/group/ratId/trial/episode"
      Instead, provide a separate logFolder for each type of log, and store all log files inside that folder, substitute tree by file name
*Make all loggers binary file loggers
*Add database
