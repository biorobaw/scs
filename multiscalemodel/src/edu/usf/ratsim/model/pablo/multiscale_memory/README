This model implements a multiscale actor critic model with discrete actions space and continuous state space.

To run the model:
	1) run one of the config set generators in the folder experiments. It will produce 2 configuration files,
	one with only the configuration information, and another including the rat ids
	2) use script "createLogFolder.py" to create the log folders
	3) use script "runSlurm.py" to execute the whole experiment
