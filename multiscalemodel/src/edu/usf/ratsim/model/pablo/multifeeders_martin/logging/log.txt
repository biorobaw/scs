	-Currently updating the model from scs v1 to v2.1
	-Finished organizing modules, must verify xml file
	-Model runs, not sure whether it should run with or without collision detection (since it supposed to be a new feature)
	    With collition detection it can get really hard for the robot to move between walls
	    Without, it gets stuck in outter walls due to unknown error
	-Currently adding drawers to view inner workings:
	   -drawer runtime per feeder  (DONE)
	   -draw feeders (enabled = blue, active=red , flashing=twice as big)
	   -drawer votes (DONE - but making it more understandable)
	*MODIFIED THE DRAW INTERFACE
	-Looking for errors:
		-Error: In GeomUtils simulate affordance was incorrect for turning affordances
		    Result should apply opposite movement (as in translation), it was applying the movement itself
		    FIXED
		-StepVirtualRobot: getMinAngle(angleLeft,angleRight)
		    Seems like it requires an absolute value
		    FIXED
		-The strategy to get the robot unstack is not working, 
		   it assumed that it could control the robot within the model but it cant anymore
		-Task Cells are pointless unless the robot ends up going to the cell it really wanted to,
		otherwise each task cell learn to go to any cell
