* Current issues:
	The software is too complicated to work with.
	Changes in scs or nsl affect all models
	Too many things encode the same things
	
	
	Interface system makes it complicated to reuse code and confusing
	Example: VirtualUniverse
	         VirtualWallUniverse
	         VirtualDiscreteUniverse
	         VirtualWallDiscreteUniverse
	         In the example above VirtualWallDiscreteUniverse must reimplement functionality from at least
	         on of the previous classes
