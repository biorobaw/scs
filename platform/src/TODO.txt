* Unify Task Interface so that tasks plotters and loggers are the same
* Change XML to a simpler markup language
* Unify Universe so that discrete is just a special case of continuous
* Create a single Universe, it should only provide basic functionality
  Complex functionality should be added as optional modules not interfaces
* Separate the simulator from the episode
* Separate experiment definition from experiment control
* Create unique robot class with loadable modules instead of interfaces
* Move nsl modules to nsl when they are unrelated to scs


* Separate the models to their own projects so that they will point to the SCS version that they work with,
  so that we dont have to update every model each time SCS works
