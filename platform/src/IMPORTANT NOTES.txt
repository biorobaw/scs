1) experiment.xml format has changed.
Plotters have been removed.
Episodes have been removed.
Elements previously specified on episodes should now be specified on trial.
Loggers are now a subclass of task and should be specified as other tasks.
The definition of variables now is done through the following syntax <variables>[<NAME>VALUE</NAME>]*</variables>


2) Method to execute experiments has changed.
Now  preExperiment, Experiment, and PostExperiment are all executed in the same way.

Execution:  javac -cp SAME_AS_IN_SCS_V2 MAIN_CLASS_SAME_AS_BEFORE  CONFIG_FILE LINE LOG_FOLDER
LOG_FOLDER is expected to exist already
LINE defines which line of the CONFIG_FILE is executed
CONFIG_FILE defines the parameters to be passed to the program
	The config file must be a csv file separate by tabs ('\t')
	The firt row must specify be the column names (names to be used as global variables)
	All other rows specify the parameter values for each execution. They must contain the same number of columns as the first row.
	At least the following columns must be specified:
		runLevel : it defines whether to run:
			 0 = pre experiment
			 1 = experiment
			 2 = post experiment
			 3 = all stages
		experiment : path to the experiment file
		config : the name assigned to the configuration, logs will be stored to the LOG_FOLDER/CONFIG_NAME
		group  : the group to which the rat belongs
		subName: the rat name (or number)
